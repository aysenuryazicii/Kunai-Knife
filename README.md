# Kunai-Knife 
----------------
Using shader-based graphics programming approach and WebGL I designed a kunai knife-dattebayo. 
The Tasks that I made for this project are:

• Finding a simple 3D geometric model 

• Modifying the teapot program so that I can show my model as a wireframe

• Implementing lighting calculations to show my shaded model using Phong polygon rendering

• Covering my model with a texture
